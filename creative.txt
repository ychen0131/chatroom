brief description of what we did for creative portion:
- Chat room is deleted when the owner quits the room. Other users in the room will automatically leave the room.
- Users in the room can share files by uploading. A url is provided to the users in the chat room to view the uploaded file. To apply this part, need to also run static_server.js on a different port number.
